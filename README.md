Fetch Request in Class Component
1. Fetch users data from the API and render it as an unordered list with name of the user.
2. Use this URL to fetch data: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users
3. The unordered list should have an id of "userlist"
4. The li items should display the name of the user object fetched. 
Hint: Call the fetch function inside the componentDidMount() method and save the response as a state. Use the state to render the list.
